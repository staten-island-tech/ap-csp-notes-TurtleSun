//const cannot modify values in var;
//ie const life = 100; and const life = 1000; equal no workie

//HOWEVER if you use let instead of const it allows the 
//change varible 

//fun facts: reserved terms such as false need no quotes
//varibles with no equal sign are undefined n have no value
//"VAR" has no value?
